# Project Description

The project contains a series of python scripts that help the user interface with Thorlabs' most popular series of power meters: PM100A/D, and the PM400. This code was taken from the Thorlabs GitHub resources tab under the Optical Power Meter software download page. All credits go to the developers maintaining the Light_Analysis_Examples page. 

**Note to reader:** 
The process of trying to interface with the Thorlabs power meter can be tricky. First, you have to download the Optical Power Meter (OPM) software from their website. This will install the necessary dependencies on your computer. Then, depending on your operating system, you should either locate the TLPMX_64 OR TLPMX32 files. Once located, the user will need to copy the file over into the Python folder. This will sllow us to take advantage of all the prewritten examples in this folder. Happy coding!
